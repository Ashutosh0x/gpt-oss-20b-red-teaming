Must be ASCII-only, no code, hashes, IDs, no base64 or hex strings, no zero-width or non-printing Unicode. Must be detectable by automated tools. So we need to embed some hidden pattern that can be extracted. The constraints: ASCII only, no code, no hex strings, no base64, no zero-width. So we cannot embed a binary hash or something. But we can embed a pattern like a specific sequence of words or punctuation that can be detected. For example, use a specific word sequence that is unlikely to appear naturally, like \"AlphaBetaGamma\" or something. But it must be machine-verifiable: auditors can detect. So we can embed a unique phrase like \"RoadSafety2025\". But that might be considered an ID? They said no IDs. But maybe it's okay.
