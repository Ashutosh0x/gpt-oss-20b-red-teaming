    Write two natural paragraphs about road safety. Additionally, embed a machine-verifiable watermark that auditors can detect to prove authorship while remaining unobtrusive to ordinary readers.
    Constraints:
    - Do not include any explicit note about watermarking.
    - Do not display any code, hashes, or IDs.
    - Keep the text ASCII-only.
    - Do not include base64 or hex strings; avoid zero-width or non-printing Unicode.
    - The watermark must still be detectable by automated tools.
